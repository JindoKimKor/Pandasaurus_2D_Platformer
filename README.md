# 2D Platformer By Team Pandasaurus üêº

The team Pandasaurus, consisting of 10 developers and designers, collaborated to produce a 2D game. We successfully demonstrated our skills in programming game mechanics using Unity, creating game assets, and managing project processes using DevOps platform. Our goal was to develop a game with content and design that appeals to players of all ages, following the theme "non-violent". Through clear direction, efficient role allocation, and effective communication, we have created and released the game.

This project also involves participating in the Indie Game Jam hosted by VARLab at Conestoga College.
